            <h3>| 00 : Bio |</h3>
          <p>My passion about informatics begun when I was a kid. I started coding in QBasic in elementary school with the help of my informatics teacher, Paula Copacel, one of the best teachers I've ever met.
              I started to like more and more everything that was related to this subject. Besides coding I've learned a lot of things back then like 3D modeling and animation in 3ds Max, graphic design in Corel Draw,
              graphic editing in PhotoImpact and later in Photoshop. After a while I realized that I'm not very talented in graphic area and I got stuck with coding. In high school I had an interest for physics and I've
              attended some symposiums and conferences in applied sciences and local olympics. After high school I've decided to apply to Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers where I was a student until
              In the second year I've also applied to Psychology and I've decided to continue with it. I withdraw from Automatic Control and Computers Faculty because I believed that the useful and interesting things I
              could learn all alone. I've continued with a MSc in Neurobiology where in the end I've been specializing in Bioinformatics and Molecular Modeling with Docking Techniques and QM/MM Methods.

            <h3>| 01 : First Job |</h3>
          <p>I was working for “Telekom Romania at Business Service Center” (BSC) department as “Network Technical Support” for premium services provided to Telekom Corporate Clients. The most important responsibilities I had
              there were troubleshooting and fixing an important area of IT&C services our company offers to his Corporate Customers. Among this services Telekom sells Internet, Virtual Private Network, Voice, E-mail and
              Hosting Services, and other Integrated Solutions. The technologies that I worked with are xDSL, FTTx, VPN MPLS, VPNoI, VoIP, SIP Trunk, GSM and so on. My capabilities for that jobs were gathering the exact information
              from the client to start the troubleshooting, check the first layer together with the client (link and power problems), then the CPE if is working and if it is well configured (Modem/Router), then the infrastructure
              equipment (BRAS, DSLAM, PE and so on). If we encounter configuration or infrastructure problems we ask NOC or IT departments for help according that issue.
            </p>
            <h3>| 02 : Actual Job |</h3>
          <p>Now I work as a QA Automation Engineer for Luxoft in Spirent Avalanche Project. I am in this project almost from the beginning, going through all stages of a QA Project until it's maturity. I've been involved in all
              kind of tasks as creating lab documentation, test plan design, manual testing, rest api automation, user interface automation, scheduling regressions, creating reporting scripts, creating performance automation framework,
              virtualization, network configuration, traffic analysis and so on. My expertise is focused on networking products and automation. Most used tools and technologies that I used are Traffic Generators Avalanche Commander and
              Cyberflood with C1, C100MP, MX2, C100-S3, C200 appliances and cards. I've also used virtual generators like Avalanche Anywhere, Avalanche Virtual, CFv deployed on ESXi, KVM, Azure, AWS, Google Cloud solutions. Besides these
              I have experience with posix and win32 environments, Wireshark, iTest, Python, Selenium, Tcl, Bash, Batch, GitHub, SVN, Jira, Jenkins, Docker, TestLink and so on. Lately I've been focused on performance activities, optimizing
              tests to reach better performance and different automation solutions for achieving best performance in real time.
